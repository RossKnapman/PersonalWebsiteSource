Here is a small assortment of figures that I made during my PhD with the [TWIST](https://www.uni-due.de/physik/twist/) and [INSPIRE](https://www.sinova-group.physik.uni-mainz.de/) groups, mainly for my [thesis](http://doi.org/10.25358/openscience-10397). I started to learn [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) shortly after the start of my PhD, but I ended up switching to [POV-Ray](https://www.povray.org/), which is the tool used to create most of the images on this page (the only exception being the H-shaped skyrmion render, for which I used Blender). Although POV-Ray is significantly older and has fewer features than Blender, I have found it to be much more simple to use where more complex mathematics is required to describe an object (with Blender, I always felt like I was having to "hack" it in order to create what I wanted, even with the Python API).

    <figcaption><p>The topology of a magnetic skyrmion comes from its homotopy group: the number of times the magnetisation covers a unit sphere is the skyrmion number \(N_{\mathrm{sk}}\). The texture defined over a unit sphere can be stereographically projected onto a two-dimensional plane.</p></figcaption>

    <figcaption><p>This animation illustrates the principle of topological protection of skyrmions. For a skyrmion to be created by a continuous deformation of the topologically trivial collinear background, an antiskyrmion must be simultaneously created.</p></figcaption>

{{< figure src="PreimagesWatermarked.png" alt="Render the the Hopf fibration." caption="Hopf fibration visualised using a stereographic projection, which provides a way to view a 4D sphere in 3D! An explanation of the mathematics behind this is given by Niles Johnson on [his website](https://nilesjohnson.net/hopf-production.html), which accompanies a [beautiful video](https://youtu.be/AKotMPGFJYk?si=eR2kTd9mbQwzfOH1) illustrating the Hopf fibration. He also has a [lecture on the subject](https://youtu.be/QXDQsmL-8Us?si=gGsCrRw2u738Aqqe) for real enthusiasts. Samuel J. Li also has an [excellent interactive tool to demonstrate the Hopf fibration](https://samuelj.li/hopf-fibration/)." >}}
