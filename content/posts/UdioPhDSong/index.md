It seems like ChatGPT has been around forever now, and despite only having used it for a year or so, many people wonder how they ever lived without it. I recently discovered that a similar service exists for audio, where songs can be generated from a prompt. One example of such a service is [Udio](https://www.udio.com/). At the time of writing, it is free to use, albeit with a limited (but generous) number of credits.

From a prompt, two song samples are generated, each roughly 30 seconds long. You can then keep extending it to your heart's content, adding an intro, more verses, and an outro, to create a complete song. With the prompt "Midwest emo song about being a PhD student at the University of Duisburg-Essen" and multiple presses of the "Extend" button, I generated the following song which Udio named "Dizzying Academia". Ironically, I generated this song just a few days after having defended my PhD ðŸ˜‰

## Lyrics
In Duisburg-Essen, clarity is so vague\
Endless paths of theory, my mind starts to ache\
[Verse 1]\
Fading sunlight, my desk lamp burns on\
Piles of notes, 'til the break of dawn\
I'm questioning knowledge, the roots of it all\
In search for answers, I rise and then I fall\
How did I know? How could I see?\
You ask me about my PhD, well\
[Chorus]\
I'm grinding my gears, yeah, it's mentally taxing\
Nobody warned that this field would be so baffling\
A hand on my books 'cause the knowledge is dizzying\
How could you judge me? Academia's mystifying\
Endless revisions, my thesis, it taunts\
Deadlines approaching like ominous haunts\
[Verse 2]\
Reading through papers, my vision is bleary\
In Duisburg-Essen, my thoughts are weary\
[Chorus]\
Pulling all-nighters, with coffee in hand\
I'm chasing citations, in this academic land\
In the libraryâ€™s glow, my sanctuary of thought\
Fighting writerâ€™s block, in scholarly battles fought\
[Chorus]\
This journey's relentless, it's a constant uphill stride\
But I'm carving out my path, with a mix of hope and pride\
I brace for critiques, in this collegiate tide\
In Duisburg-Essen, Iâ€™ll find my scholarly stride\
[Bridge]\
My friends are out there, life passing them by\
While I'm trapped here with theories that tie\
Together the fragments of what I believe\
In Duisburg-Essen, it's hard to breathe\
[Verse 3]\
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth the fight\
These sleepless nights, under fluorescent light\
But through the fog, I see glimpses so bright\
Hope flickers softly, in the dead of night\
[Chorus]\
The weight on my shoulders, it's hard to ignore\
In Duisburg-Essen, I'll endure a little more\
With each page I turn, and each draft I write\
I'm forging my dream, in this endless academic night\
[Verse 4]\
Wandering the hallways, where shadows play tricks\
Lost in reflection, as the clock slowly ticks\
In Duisburg-Essen, dreams intertwine\
With frustrations and hopes, in a scholarly line\
[Chorus]\
I'm grinding my gears, yeah, it's mentally taxing\
Nobody warned that this field would be so baffling
