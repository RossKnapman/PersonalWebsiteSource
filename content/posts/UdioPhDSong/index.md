It seems like ChatGPT has been around forever now, and despite only having used it for a year or so, many people wonder how they lived without it. I recently discovered that a similar concept exists for audio, in which songs can be generated from a prompt. One example of such a service is [Udio](https://www.udio.com/) which, at the time of writing, is free to use, albeit with a limited (but generous) number of credits.

From a prompt, two song samples, each of roughly 30 seconds, are generated, lyrics included. You can then keep extending it to your heart's content, adding an intro, more verses, and an outro, to create a complete song. With the prompt "midwest emo song about being a phd student at the University of Duisburg-Essen", along with multiple presses of the "Extend" button, I generated the following song, which Udio named "Dizzying Academia". Ironically, I generated this song just a few days after having defended my PhD 😉

## Lyrics
In Duisburg-Essen, clarity is so vague\
Endless paths of theory, my mind starts to ache\
[Verse 1]\
Fading sunlight, my desk lamp burns on\
Piles of notes, 'til the break of dawn\
I'm questioning knowledge, the roots of it all\
In search for answers, I rise and then I fall\
How did I know? How could I see?\
You ask me about my PhD, well\
[Chorus]\
I'm grinding my gears, yeah, it's mentally taxing\
Nobody warned that this field would be so baffling\
A hand on my books 'cause the knowledge is dizzying\
How could you judge me? Academia's mystifying\
Endless revisions, my thesis, it taunts\
Deadlines approaching like ominous haunts\
[Verse 2]\
Reading through papers, my vision is bleary\
In Duisburg-Essen, my thoughts are weary\
[Chorus]\
Pulling all-nighters, with coffee in hand\
I'm chasing citations, in this academic land\
In the library’s glow, my sanctuary of thought\
Fighting writer’s block, in scholarly battles fought\
[Chorus]\
This journey's relentless, it's a constant uphill stride\
But I'm carving out my path, with a mix of hope and pride\
I brace for critiques, in this collegiate tide\
In Duisburg-Essen, I’ll find my scholarly stride\
[Bridge]\
My friends are out there, life passing them by\
While I'm trapped here with theories that tie\
Together the fragments of what I believe\
In Duisburg-Essen, it's hard to breathe\
[Verse 3]\
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth the fight\
These sleepless nights, under fluorescent light\
But through the fog, I see glimpses so bright\
Hope flickers softly, in the dead of night\
[Chorus]\
The weight on my shoulders, it's hard to ignore\
In Duisburg-Essen, I'll endure a little more\
With each page I turn, and each draft I write\
I'm forging my dream, in this endless academic night\
[Verse 4]\
Wandering the hallways, where shadows play tricks\
Lost in reflection, as the clock slowly ticks\
In Duisburg-Essen, dreams intertwine\
With frustrations and hopes, in a scholarly line\
[Chorus]\
I'm grinding my gears, yeah, it's mentally taxing\
Nobody warned that this field would be so baffling
