*** I can’t find the text align button, to align the text within the text box
It shows up when you’re typing the text itself, then goes away, contrary to with older versions.
*** Extensions are not shown in the Extensions menu
First, make sure you’re looking in the right place. For example, Tex Text was hidden under the Text menu, and when I searched for it, I typed it as one word, so it didn’t show up. The information here is also useful: https://textext.github.io/textext/usage/faq.html#extension-not-shown-in-the-inkscape-extension-menu
I had a problem when I tried to set the Python interpreter as described in the link above, that, when I opened up Inkscape again, it had been set back to the system default Python, instead of my miniconda installation. I overcame this by deleted all of the backup preferences.xml files that had been created.
*** The LaTeX extension is greyed out
Open from command line, 'open /Applications.Inkscape.app'
