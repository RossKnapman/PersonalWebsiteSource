*** Find and Replace
Search and replace globally: ~:%s/foo/bar/g~

~:s~ is the command to substitute, ~%~ means to apply within the current file, rather than just the current line, ~g~ means global, i.e. it replaces all instances, not just the first

To find and replace regex whilst keeping part of a pattern, e.g. if you want to replace #1 #2 #3 by #1 \, #2 \, #3 \n, then need to run

~:s/\d/\1 \\,/g~

where the brackets store the variable \d, which is accessed by \1
*** Side-By-Side Comparison of Two Files
~vimdiff <FILE1> <FILE2>~
*** Macros
~:%norm! @a~ to apply macro a to all lines
*** VimTeX and Inverse Search
**** Allowing Backwards Search with VimTeX on Mac
Start vim with ~vim --servername <some name>~
**** Neovim + VimTeX + Zathura
Install ~neovim-remote~ using ~pip3 install neovim-remote~.

Set ~$NVIM_LISTEN_ADDRESS=/tmp/nvimsocket~ in ~.bashrc~, ~.zshrc~, etc. for whichever shell you are using (I think Zathura takes care of this for you, but this may be necessary for other PDF viewers). Then when you start a Neovim instance, you can call commands in that Neovim session from another terminal window using e.g. ~nvr --remote file1~ if you want to open file1.

Ensure ~synctex~ is enabled, e.g. by putting ~\synctex=1~ in your ~.tex~ document.

In ~\~/.config/nvim/init.vim~, put

#+BEGIN_SRC
let g:vimtex_view_method = 'zathura'
let g:latex_view_general_viewer = 'zathura'
let g:vimtex_compiler_progname = 'nvr'
#+END_SRC

In ~\~/.config/zathura/zathurarc~, put

#+BEGIN_SRC
set synctex true
set synctex-editor-command "nvr --remote-silent +%{line} %{input}"
#+END_SRC

Then you should be able to Ctrl-Click on a part of the file in Zathura, and Neovim will go to that point in the ~.tex~ file. Note that this will only work after a change has been made to the file, i.e. it won't work if you just open the file and try to reverse search; you need to make a change and save it first.
*** Vim Gives an Error Message Relating to UltiSnips and Python When a Key is Pressed
Probably using vi instead of vim. Change the editor of whatever youâ€™re doing to vim, or need to run ~python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pynvim~.
