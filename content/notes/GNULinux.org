*** Determining IP Address on Ubuntu
~ip addr show~
*** Finding out If a Command Is Available to Run on Ubuntu
~compgen -c | grep <COMMAND>~
*** Disk Usage
In current directory: ~du -h . --max-depth=1~ on Ubuntu or ~du -hd1~. on macOS
*** Installing GNU/Linux on an Apple Computer
On Mac, no screen when booting installation: highlight the boot option, press e, add ~radeon.modeset=0~ to the menu that pops up, then press enter. I spent ages to arrive at that!!

*** trash-cli not going to ~/.local/share/Trash/files
It is probably going to ~/files/scratch/.Trash~
*** Using Gnome Settings in i3
~XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=Gnome && gnome-control-center~
*** Enabling Compose Key for Typing Accented Letters
Often, in a desktop environment, there is a way to do this through the settings. Otherwise,

In ~~/.Xmodmap~, add

#+BEGIN_SRC
keycode 108 = Multi_key Alt_R Meta_R Alt_R Meta_R
#+END_SRC

May need to change the keycode depending on the keyboard; see https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Keyboard_input#Identifying_keycodes_in_Xorg.

To source this, run ~xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap~. To use with i3, add ~exec --no-startup-id "xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap"~ to ~\~/.config/i3/config~.
*** Kernel Module Not Loaded on Startup
Check it is not blacklisted. You can run ~journalctl -b~ and search for the module, and it might say it was blacklisted, "deny-listed", etc. There may be an entry in ~/etc/modprobe.d/~ blacklisting it. If not, there may also be one in ~/usr/lib/modprobe.d~.
*** Network Interface Not Showing
If the network interface does now show when running ~ip link~, try running ~lspci -k~ to see find the relevant kernel module. You can manually load this kernel module by running ~modprobe <module>~ as root. If this works, it is likely that the module is blacklisted from loading on startup; see [[*Kernel Module Not Loaded on Startup][Kernel Module Not Loaded on Startup]]
*** Screen Order for Dual Monitor
See which displays are connected using ~xrandr~. Say you want display DP-2 to be the primary display, which is to the left of DP-0, run ~xrandr --output DP-2 --primary --auto --left-of DP-0~. To save this configuration by running this on startup, put it in ~/.xprofile~.
*** No Display After ~pacman -Syu~ with Nvidia Graphics
This can happen if you installed the Nvidia driver from the Nvidia website rather than using Pacman, as described [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA#Installation][here]]. Uninstall the existing Nvidia drivers using the the commande [[https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#runfile-uninstallation][here]], then reinstall using ~pacman -S nvidia~, and ~pacman -S nvidia-utils~.
