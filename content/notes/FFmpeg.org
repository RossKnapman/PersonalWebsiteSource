*** Joining Videos Side-By-Side with FFmpeg
This all also works for images

Getting information about the video (resolution, fps etc.):
~ffprobe file.mp4~

Basic usage (more work needed for sound):
~ffmpeg -i left.mp4 -i right.mp4 -filter_complex hstack output.mp4~

If the files are of different heights:
~ffmpeg -i In.mp4 -vf scale=-1:<height> Out.mp4~

If the resulting width is not an even number:
~ffmpeg -i Out.mp4 -vf scale=iw-1:ih Out.mp4~

OR

change the -1 to -2 in the earlier command
*** Converting to QuickTime-Playable Format
~ffmpeg -i <InFile> -pix_fmt yuv420p <OutFile>
*** Animation from Stills
~ffmpeg -framerate <framerate> -i /path/to/%04d.png -r <framerate> -pix_fmt yuv420p Out.mp4~
Replace -4 with however many leading zeros. Can also use e.g. m%06d.png for e.g. m000123.png from MuMax3.

If you want to specify a background colour (e.g. white), add e.g. ~-filter_complex "[0]split=2[bg][fg];[bg]drawbox=c=white@1:replace=1:t=fill[bg];                                                                                       [bg][fg]overlay=format=auto"~
*** Speed Up Video
~ffmpeg -i <Input> -filter:v "setpts=<Factor>*PTS" <OutName>~
where a smaller factor results in a higher speedup, i.e. Factor=0.1 results in the video being 0.1* the original length
