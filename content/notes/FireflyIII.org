*** Migrate to New Server (Assuming Docker Installation)
Shamelessly stolen from https://github.com/orgs/firefly-iii/discussions/8241, but re-writing here in case that thread gets lost.

On the old server:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker exec -ti <db_container> bash
apt update && apt install mysql-client
mysqldump -u firefly --column-statistics=0 -p firefly > /tmp/firefly.sql
exit
docker cp <db_container>:/tmp/firefly.sql .
#+END_SRC

On the new server:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker cp firefly.sql <db_container>:/tmp/firefly.sql
docker exec -ti <db_container> bash
apt update && apt install mysql-client
rm -rf /var/lib/mysql/firefly
mysql -u firefly -p firefly
create database firefly
use firefly;
source /tmp/firefly.sql; -> see EDIT
exit
exit
#+END_SRC

If there are problems, it may be due to mismatching versions of Firefly III on the two machines

On their EDIT:
When you get errors such as: ~ERROR 1100 (HY000): Table 'invited_users' was not locked with LOCK TABLES~. Remove those tables from the database
#+BEGIN_SRC
SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0;
drop table invited_users`;
source /tmp/firefly.sql
#+END_SRC
