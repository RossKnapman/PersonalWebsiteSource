*** Viewing Dashboards (Grafana, Home Assistant, etc) on Old iPad
Often the lastest versions of dashboard apps such as Grafana are not compatible with older versions of Safari on old devices (such as my 2012 iPad Mini which I would like to use as a simple dashboard viewer).

A workaround is to install a Firefox Docker container and use that to view the dashboard, as described [[https://community.home-assistant.io/t/options-for-lovelace-on-older-ipad-ios-9-3-5/125497/4][here]]. It's a bit hacky but not as annoying as trying to jailbreak the old iPad just for this purpose...

Or use [[https://github.com/tenox7/wrp][WRP]], described in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/1028lbf/old_ipad_as_a_grafana_dashboard/][this Reddit post]].
