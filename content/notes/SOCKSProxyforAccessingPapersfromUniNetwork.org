Title = "SOCKS Proxy for Accessing Papers from Uni Network"
+++

This is an alternative to using a VPN, which is nice in that it only routes your traffic from a single browser window (and works if the university VPN is down, which happens sometimes).

~ssh -D 8080 ws2~

Then open Firefox, go to Network Settings -> Manual proxy configuration, enter SOCKS Host 127.0.0.1, Port 8080

~ws2~ is what I have called twist-ws02 in my SSH config.

I find that a better solution is to define an alias in ~.zshrc~ (or equivalent for whichever shell you use) like

~alias jguprox='ssh -D 8080 -fN ws2 && /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome \ --user-data-dir="$HOME/proxy-profile" \ --proxy-server="socks5://localhost:8080" && pkill ssh'~

Then I can simply run ~jguprox~ and it opens up a Chrome window.
