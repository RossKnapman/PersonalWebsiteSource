Education 
=========

#### 2019 - Present | PhD, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany
\\
I am currently researching the properties and dynamics of topological magnetic structures using a mixture of analytical and numerical methods. I work under the supervision of [Dr. Karin Everschor-Sitte](https://www.twist.uni-mainz.de/dr-karin-everschor-sitte/), and my current work involves investigating the shedding of magnetic structures from magnetic impurities in two and three dimensions.


#### 2015 - 2019 | MPhys, Durham University, Durham, England

**MPhys Physics, First Class Honours** \\
\\
Throughout my studies, I obtained firsts (the highest grade in UK universities) in all modulesfrom my second year onwards. This is in addition to undertaking an internship during each summer throughout my degree, as well as being a member of the executive committees of various university societies. \\
\\
My fourth-year project, supervised by [Prof. Peter Hatton](https://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/staff/profiles/?id=540), involved using micromagnetic simulations to investigate the resonance modes of antiskyrmions. \\
