Education 
=========

#### 2019 - Present | PhD, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany
I am currently researching the properties and dynamics of topological magnetic structures using a mixture of analytical and numerical methods. I work under the supervision of [Dr. Karin Everschor-Sitte](https://www.twist.uni-mainz.de/dr-karin-everschor-sitte/), and my current work involves investigating the shedding of magnetic structures from magnetic impurities in two and three dimensions.


#### 2015 - 2019 | MPhys, Durham University, Durham, England

**MPhys Physics, First Class Honours** \\
Throughout my studies, I obtained firsts (the highest grade in UK universities) in all modules from my second year onwards. This is in addition to undertaking an internship during each summer throughout my degree, as well as being a member of the executive committees of various university societies, as described below. \\
\\
My [fourth-year project]({{ site.url }}/download/FourthYearReport.pdf), supervised by [Prof. Peter Hatton](https://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/staff/profiles/?id=540), involved using micromagnetic simulations to investigate the resonance modes of antiskyrmions. \\
\\
During my studies, I held a number of positions on the executive committees of university societies, including Co-President of the Durham University Physics Society and Secretary of the Durham University Astronomical Society. \\

A full list of the courses I took, as well as my raw marks in each, can be found [here]({{ site.url }}/download/Courses.pdf).


#### 2013 - 2015 | A Levels, Paston College, North Walsham, England[^1]
Physics - A* \\
Chemistry - A* \\
Mathematics - A* \\
Further Mathematics - A \\
AS Biology - A \\
AS Critical Thinking - A \\
\\
In addition to my A Level studies, I undertook some work experience placements, as well as obtaining Silver certificates in both the 2015 UK Chemistry Olympiad and the 2014 UKMT Senior Mathematical Challenge. I was also awarded the Sir William Paston Scholarship worth Â£500 in recognition of outstanding GCSE results. I also taught myself AS Level further mathematics over the summer break between the academic years of A Levels in preparation for classes to obtain the full A Level.


#### 2011 - 2013 | GCSEs, Broadland High School, Hoveton, England[^2]
Physics: A\*, Chemistry: A\*, Biology: A\*, Mathematics: A\*, Religious Studies: A\*, Geography: A\*, English Language: A\*, English Literature: A, Information Technology: A, French: A

[^1]: A levels are the qualifications that many people complete in the UK in preparation for university, typically between the ages of 16 and 18. Unlike in many countries where students study many more subjects up to 18, students typically study four subjects in their first year of A levels (all of which are their own choice), and drop down to three in their second year. When I was doing A Levels, dropping a subject after one year rather than studying it for the entire two years resulted in obtaining an 'AS Level' in that subject.
[^2]: The qualifications obtained in the UK between the ages of 14 and 16, before leaving high school and going to e.g. sixth form.
